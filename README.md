# Some problems I have:
1.As you can see in the notebook, I tried to implement projected bfgs through two different ways: iterative and recursion. In the book, it gave a pesudocode of recursive manner. I tried this, but it seems impossible for the recursive implementation to terminate when the number of nodes is above 50.
